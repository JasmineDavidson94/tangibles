A message intended for me about a virus was erroneously sent to a mailing

is no need for anyone else to do so.

| Hi,
|
| In case any of you are still looking for accomodations for your parents
for
| graduation, here is an opening for you.  There are rooms available for the
| nights of Friday, June 7 & Saturday, June 8 at
|
| The Samuel Sewall Inn
| 143 St. Paul Street
| Brookline, MA
| 617-713-0123
|
| This is a nice place next to Coolidge Corner. I booked a bunch of rooms
for
| my family Wednesday-Saturday, but now they want to stay only for Wednesday
&
| Thursday. I am responsible for the other two nights because of their
| cancellation policy.  This is why I am desperately advertising the rooms.
|
| I apologize for the spam!

LATE-BREAKING SUMMER UROP POSITIONS AVAILABLE

The Life Long Kindergarten Group at the Media Lab is building a system
to allow all creative people to easily design, fabricate and exchange
tangible objects.  By allowing people to collectively share and evolve
their creations, the system will be a catalyst for building community in
a social setting.  It will debut at a September symposium that brings
together artists, researchers and scientist interested in the interplay
between contemporary craft and digital media.

We are looking for three undergraduates with extensive programming
experience who want to play a substantial role in the design and
implementation of a real system.   Experience with Java, 3D, SQL, and/or
fabrication are big plusses, as is  interest in helping out at the
symposium in beautiful, coastal Maine.  Please send an email or resume
to willow@media.mit.edu documenting your interest and experience.
